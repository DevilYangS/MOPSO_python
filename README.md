# basic_MOPSO
based on the version of "https://github.com/dreamoffeature/mopso", which has too many mistakes, I rewrite the MOPSO algorithm, some kernel 
operators are learned from PlatEMO, which is based on MATLAB. Although the performance of MOPSO  is not well with respect to multimodal 
problem, you can run main.py to run MOPSO
